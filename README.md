Delivery Order Management System

Project Overview

During my first and second year of college, I worked a part-time job where I manually entered delivery records into a database. The payment of staff and delivery personnel depended on these records, making accuracy crucial. Managing these records manually was time-consuming and prone to errors.

To solve this problem, I developed the Delivery Order Management System, an automated platform that efficiently manages delivery records with accuracy and reliability.

How It Works

Sellers who sell products to customers can add delivery orders to the system.

Delivery boys can view all available orders in real-time.

Admins assign deliveries to specific delivery personnel.

Once a delivery is completed, the system automatically updates the records, ensuring accurate tracking of payments and order fulfillment.


Key Benefits

✅ Eliminates manual record-keeping errors.

✅ Automates the assignment of deliveries.

✅ Ensures transparency and accuracy in payments.

✅ Improves efficiency in delivery operations.
